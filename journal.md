# April 10th
In this class session, we divided our work into hourglass prototyping and illustrator designing. Nathan mainly worked on the hourglass prototype, and Gautham and Soojin were designing the acrylic cutouts. 

## Hourglass prototype
Due to a lack of acrylic material, we decided to use cardboard to simulate an acrylic hourglass. In the previous class, we had breifly lasercut a cardboard hourglass, and that was the hourglass we worked with in this prototype. The main difference between cardboard and acrylic for our project was that we had to address the holes on the side of the cardboards, which we simly taped up. Here is the cardboard hourglass:

Next, we glued the cardboard hourglass to a flat cardboard surface, and then started filling in the hourglass with sand. Since we want the sand from the hourglass to provide a solid filling for the plywood cutout in the front, the sand needed to perfectly fill in half of the hourglass. After some trial and error, the sand filling was completed, and we moved onto gluing a transparent acrylic board onto the sand-filled hourglass. This proved to be the hardest part of the prototype, as the acrylic board was heavy and hard to glue seamlessly onto the uneven cardboard surface. We tried glue guns, white glue, and acrylic glue, but none of the options worked. In the end, since the hourglass was only a prototype to test the flow rate, we decided to just use clamps to hold down all sides of the acrylic board. The prototype looked like this:

Even with using as many clamps as we did, the sand was still leaking from the sides, as well as going around the hourglass as it flowed down into the bottom. However, most of the sand flowed decently through the hole of the hourglass, and we were able to find out that a 5mm hole is much too big. The total flow time did not even last five seconds. Overall, this prototyping session was very helpful for us in getting a rough estimate of the hourglass dimensions. Here are some videos of the prototype:

# April 12th
Gautham and Soojin finalized their illustrator work from April 10th, and plan to lasercut their design on April 13th. Here is the current design:

The black circle in the middle is the area where the hourglass will rotate. The thick black strokes are all areas that will be laser etched into the plywood surface, and the think pink lines will be the places where the plywood is laser cut. There are three sections of these laser cuts, including the sand dune at the top, the U.A.E. skyline, and the wheels of the jeep underneath the skyline.
