# April 10th
In this class session, we divided our work into hourglass prototyping and illustrator designing. Nathan mainly worked on the hourglass prototype, and Gautham and Soojin were designing the acrylic cutouts. 

## Hourglass prototype
Due to a lack of acrylic material, we decided to use cardboard to simulate an acrylic hourglass. In the previous class, we had breifly lasercut a cardboard hourglass, and that was the hourglass we worked with in this prototype. The main difference between cardboard and acrylic for our project was that we had to address the holes on the side of the cardboards, which we simly taped up. Here is the cardboard hourglass:

</p>

Next, we glued the cardboard hourglass to a flat cardboard surface, and then started filling in the hourglass with sand. Since we want the sand from the hourglass to provide a solid filling for the plywood cutout in the front, the sand needed to perfectly fill in half of the hourglass. After some trial and error, the sand filling was completed, and we moved onto gluing a transparent acrylic board onto the sand-filled hourglass. This proved to be the hardest part of the prototype, as the acrylic board was heavy and hard to glue seamlessly onto the uneven cardboard surface. We tried glue guns, white glue, and acrylic glue, but none of the options worked. In the end, since the hourglass was only a prototype to test the flow rate, we decided to just use clamps to hold down all sides of the acrylic board. The prototype looked like this:

Even with using as many clamps as we did, the sand was still leaking from the sides, as well as going around the hourglass as it flowed down into the bottom. However, most of the sand flowed decently through the hole of the hourglass, and we were able to find out that a 5mm hole is much too big. The total flow time did not even last five seconds. Overall, this prototyping session was very helpful for us in getting a rough estimate of the hourglass dimensions. Here are some videos of the prototype:

# April 12th
Gautham and Soojin finalized their illustrator work from April 10th, and plan to lasercut their design on April 13th. Here is the current design:

The black circle in the middle is the area where the hourglass will rotate. The thick black strokes are all areas that will be laser etched into the plywood surface, and the think pink lines will be the places where the plywood is laser cut. There are three sections of these laser cuts, including the sand dune at the top, the U.A.E. skyline, and the wheels of the jeep underneath the skyline.

During this class, we focused on prototyping and testing our laser cutting design.

## Prototyping
### Motor
Nathan and Soojin worked primarily on the prototyping process. Soojin focused on testing the hourglass, while Nathan worked on testing the motor. For the motor testing, our primary concern was the capability of the servo motor in handling the weight of the piece. We used a piece of plywood that was similar in weight to the final hourglass, bolted the servo motor onto the wood, and tested its turning ability. Despite Nathan eyeballing its centering on the wood, we found no concerns regarding the motor's capabilities for the final piece.

It's important to note that we originally designed a structure that would secure the motor to the hourglass. However, after realizing that the motor had its own securing mechanisms, we no longer believe that we need any additional mechanisms to secure the motor to the hourglass. Please see the photos and videos of the motor prototyping process below.

## Laser Cutting
Gautham led the laser cut design testing process. The cardboard result looked great, but the laser cutting machine in the IM lab was not large enough for the full scale of our project. Therefore, we scaled down the design just to test it out. Here is how it turned out:

The initial result had some errors, such as the sand dune not being cut out and the skyline on the bottom being proportionally smaller than the sand dunes. To fix these issues, we decided to make the skyline bigger in our next design and change the skyline from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, where the building heights are more even. Additionally, we were not happy with the star design, so we changed them to actual star shapes in the second design. Please see the second design below.
